The following will show you how to install a Twphper onto your site

First off [http://twphper.com download] The latest release of Twphper from the website. Extract the .zip into your directory. Upload the "ext" and "skins" directory to the same location your Twphper will be located.

Include the Twphper Class on your page
{{{
require_once 'twphper.php';
}}}

Create a new instance of Your Twphper

{{{
require "twphper.php"; 	 // including the Twphper Class
$twitter= 'twphper'; 	 // PUT YOUR TWITTER ACCOUNT USERNAME HERE!!
$skin =   'default'; 	 // the directory name of the skin
$jquery=0;				 // load jquery?
$count=25;				 // how many tweets to generate
$details=true;			 // if set to true will output date and give link to tweet on double click

$twphper = new twphper($twitter,$skin,$jquery,$count,$details); //create new instance of twphper
}}}

So that means
The Twitter account "twphper" will be loaded with the default skin, Jquery will be included into the page, 25 tweets will be displayed, and details will be turned on.

Call Javascript and Skin inside your HTML HEAD section
{{{
echo $twphper->meta();
}}}

And finally create your Twphper in the place you want your Twphper to appear.

{{{
echo $twphper->create();
}}}
